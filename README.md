This project focuses on predicting the price of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using *Machine Learning* techniques.  
It includes a dataset of 200 EV models with various features such as range, battery capacity, charging time, and more.  

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates EV prices based on these key parameters.
