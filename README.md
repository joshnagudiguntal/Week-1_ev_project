# EV Price Prediction Project

This project includes a synthetic dataset of 200 Electric Vehicle models and a Jupyter Notebook performing price prediction using Machine Learning.

**Files:**
- `ev_dataset.csv`: dataset with 200 EV entries
- `EV_Price_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb`: analysis and ML model notebook
- `README.md`: project details

**Problem Statement:**
Can we predict the price of an Electric Vehicle based on its technical specifications such as battery capacity, range, efficiency, and top speed?

**How to Run:**
1. Unzip the files.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to explore and reproduce the analysis.
